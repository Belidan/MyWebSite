title: "Skills"
description: "My skills i trained so far. 
Since it is difficult to judge what e.g. an experienced programmer is i will try to quantify it.
You can see the estimated working hours in the specific programming language or software in the first square.
The connected squares describe deeper information about the content of the working hours, like working with specific technology or library.
 Sometimes it is difficult to distinguish the working hours for every technology (as an example: while working with the robot operating system in one project one part was image processing with openCV).
 So i decided not to estimate working hours for every subsquare.
This allows a better understanding of my skills.
There are no private projects hours added."
