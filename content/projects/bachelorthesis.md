In the industrial sector of composite materials there are no measurement systems which allow combining and visualizing a set of 3D scan data with 2D pictures. The aim of this thesis is to develop software that can fill this gap. The program allows the user to texture 3D models with the fitting set of picture informations. Windows WPF was used as a framework. It provides the possibility of model generating. As a part task a human machine interface for interacting is under development. The main emphasis is the algorithm for evaluating and preparation of picture data information as well as applying on the surface of the 3D visualized model. For this task several implementations and challenges of different concepts were examined. As a part of some concepts a registration technique should be used. Due to its problems the technical limits of the registration were determined. Because of the large data sets and the resulting computation costs the software is continuously being optimized for a better performance.
