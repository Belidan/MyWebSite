As an student project we developed an acoustic camera. A matrix made out of microphones the acoustic signals were cought. The runtime of the sonic wave between the microphones was used to estimate the direction of the sound source. It was calculated on an FPGA. Via an USP-Port the results were sent to the PC and shown on an refreshing image. <br>
My part was to designing the protocoll between PC and FPGA, develop the interface for the visual output program as well as implementing the necessary communication software (steer/control data flow FPGA<->PC, transmitting processed data to visual output).
