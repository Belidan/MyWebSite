As simultaneous location and mapping (SLAM) is one of the key features for autonomous systems to navigate within the environment, at lot of progress have been accieved in the last years.
 If the environment is not changing the accuracy for SLAM is quite good, as the map is created once it should not be updated later.
 But the world is not static, it is changing over time. My research project accieved an approach to challenge with a changing world.
 While assembling a regular map my approach creates three additional maps to save timestamps: occupied, free and unknown. Therefore the spatial world is linked with passing time.
 Analyzing this timestamps allows to make an estimation wheter the sparse information is right or should be updated. For more information you can download the report below.
