This master thesis exmpands the related work of my last project ([Self learning Pipeline]({{< relref "slp.md" >}})) with the ability for grasp pose detection and manipulation of the environment.

Object recognition is one of the major topics in developing intelligent autonomous
systems. But to develop a fully autonomous system which is able to gain information
about the environment including interaction within, a lot of additional tasks
are required such as processing of the sensor inputs leading to a representation of
different objects which is needed for object recognition. Without the manipulation
possibility of the surrounding an autonomous system might not be possible to gather
detailed information about objects. In addition object recognition results are needed
for further processing or interactions.
This is why we introduce our autonomous system development project. The approach
includes all necessary process steps to gain a digital representation of an object.
It starts with preprocessing of inputs, extracting data of interest, environment
manipulation to obtain additional information and finally data fusion to accomplish
a depiction of the gained data. The result can be used for every task which needs a
3D-Representation of objects as a point cloud or a mesh.
