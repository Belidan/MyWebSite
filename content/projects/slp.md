The focus of this research project was object recognition in autonomous systems.
After study the research and adjacent fields of object recognition my focus was to develop an automated process for 3D object generation leading to a curious robot.
The resulst is the Self Learning Pipeline (SLP).
The pipeline contains the steps from extracing possible objects parts from a raw point cloud as input, tracking one object, get different views of the tracked object, registrate these object parts to a whole point cloud representing an object and finally the synthesis to a full 3D mesh which can be used for object recogintion or every other task with the need of 3D models.
