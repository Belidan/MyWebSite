Since 2015 one of my hobbies is the exchange trade as a day trader. 
It was my entrance to get a clou how the economy in the world works and the value of money leading to a fundamental financial education.
Furthermore it increases my skills of understanding complex processes and connections to each other as well as estimating/analysing consequences based on the underlying impacts.
