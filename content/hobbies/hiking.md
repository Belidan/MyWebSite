Since i can remember im into hiking. 
I love the challenge to reach a destination which might be far away. 
It is the perfect way to calm down and to free your mind.
With every step you can feel how the problems of your everyday life drops off.
Now the mind is released, the perfect moment to ruminate about the uncommon. 
Hiking is my way to meditate about the world and find my inner peace.
