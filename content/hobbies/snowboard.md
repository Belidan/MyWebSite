The top of the track, heart is beating.
I put on my boots, ready for takeoff.
Riding down the track, the body full of adrenalin. 
Full control of the body and intense concentration is the key for this sport, because at my boarding speed every moment of unwariness might be my last.
It is a tightrope, all the time.
But totally worth it. 
Isn't it amazing when the ice crystals twinkling in the sunlight while shooting along the track?
