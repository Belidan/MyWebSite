Salt in the air, wind in the hair, sailing is freedom. 
Possible to reach destinations impossible reaching by feet.
Slide over the waves and feel the force of the elements.
It is truely an andventure.

How is it to stay arround one week on a tiny boat with nine other persons?
Social and team skills are more than necessary for this. 
Because disagreements are not preventable.
And of course beside this a ship only works with a crew act as an unit.
Take the chance to learn more about physics of wind and water, cartography and navigation.
For me sailing is the extension of hiking.
